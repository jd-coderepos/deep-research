Assistant: Tidal Forces
============

Tidal forces are the forces of attraction that exist between two celestial bodies such as the Earth and the Moon, or between two planets. These forces are caused by the gravitational pull between the two objects. The tidal forces can have significant effects on the Earth's oceans, causing tides to rise and fall.

How does a tidal force work?
----------------------------

Tidal forces are caused by the difference in gravitational pull between the side of an object that is closer to a celestial body and the side that is farther away. This difference in gravitational pull causes a distortion in the shape of the object, which results in the tides. The magnitude of the tidal force depends on the mass and distance of the two objects and the distance between them.
