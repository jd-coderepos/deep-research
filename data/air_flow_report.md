Part 1: Understanding Air Flow

Q: What is air flow?
A: Air flow refers to the movement of air, which is a mixture of gases and particulates that surrounds us. It is the process of air moving from one location to another, either naturally or as a result of human intervention. Air flow can occur in various ways, such as through the movement of air within a room, through a duct system, or through the natural movement of air in the atmosphere.

Q: How is air flow measured?
A: Air flow can be measured using various methods, depending on the type of system and the specific application. Some common methods include:

1. Velocity: Velocity is the speed of air flow, measured in feet per minute (fpm) or meters per second (mps). It can be measured using an anemometer, which is a device that measures the speed of air.
2. Volume: Volume is the amount of air that passes through a given area or space over a certain period. It can be measured using a volumetric flow rate, which is calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area of the flow channel by the average velocity of the air flow.
3. Temperature:
